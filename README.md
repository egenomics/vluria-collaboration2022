This repository contains the analysis done with the dataset for secondary structure prediction and pfam domains across the different protein ages groups. The code (**code** folder) used consists of a python2 script that generates all the intermediate results and an R script to generate the tables and figures (**results** folder).
**Hs_PP_XMLs** and **Hs_PfamA_raw** contain the original files provided by Victor Luria and Amir Karger.
There is a summary of the results in the drafts folder.
